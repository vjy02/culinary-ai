## About The App
[Name of project] is a Chat-GPT3 powered web application that suggests recipes based on users preferred ingridients and exclusions. New suggestions are generated each time.

## Technologies
I used `React.js`, `Vite.js`, `TailWindCSS`, `html`, `css`

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

## Approach
I wanted to integrate the new Chat-GPT3 API while also learning TailWindCSS for the first time. I knew recipe makers already exist, but none use the power of AI to make 
tailored suggestions towards the user. I hope to add more "options" for the user to select in the future (e.g. themed based recipes) alongside implementing a backend for users to save 
some of their favorite recipes.

## Status
[Name of project] is still in progress. `Version 2` will be out later.
